We're training a new state-of-the-art extra-large language model called ELLM. We'll finally be able to solve the ultimate problem of computer science: Telling humans and robots apart. We built a crowd-sourcing application for all humans to
help us make sure those darn robots are not able to hide among us.

However, we've heard that the robots have been able to infiltrate our company and hide a secret message in our data. We need you to find it and report it to us. Unfortunately our data center was taken over by the robots and we can't access
the data anymore. Here's the last version we have been able to reconstruct from our source-code backups. Unfortunately, the backup did not include the secret file. We need your help to save humanity!

This challenge uses byte-pair-encoding on the user-input together with some other text containing the flag. By injecting the right bytes, the flag can be extracted piece by piece via the resulting tokens. If a matching flag piece is injected, the resulting text will be counted as appearing multiple times and will be added as a separate token. This can be used to extract the flag.
