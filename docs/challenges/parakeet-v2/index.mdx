In this challenge, you have to find the flag hidden in a Parquet file.
Parquet is a format used in artificial intelligence to store tabular information efficiently.
You can find information about the Parquet file format [here](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/).
There are many online tools that can be used to see analyze the file... you just need to find the right one!

v2: This time, it was hidden a bit better.

<Spoilers type="writeup">

The flag is in the creator field metadata, but this time it is not in plain text.
It is chunked and stored as single-characters and cannot be `strings`-ed.
