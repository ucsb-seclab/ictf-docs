You open your mailbox and find a strange postcard (invite.bmp).
Flipping it around, you squint your eyes and try to decipher the wobbly handwriting:

MYSTERIOUS INVITE: 'On this most auspicious end of year, I _otter_ invite you to my most magnanimous island party!'

YOU: 'This must be one of rich Jared's infamous parties, huh.'

MYSTERIOUS INVITE: 'Generative AI is all the rage this days, so I couldn't pass up the opportunity to use it for this year's invite.
Have you heard models like Google's Imagen will include a hidden watermark on AI generated images?
I might not have algorithms quite as fancy as Google's, but I've also encoded a little something into this invite--the address!
Decode it, and you'll be more than welcome to attend.'

YOU: 'Who on Earth tells their guests to just figure out the address themselves?!'

MYSTERIOUS INVITE: 'One last piece of advice. All great thing come in three. Three sides to a triangle, three wise monkeys, three lights in a stoplight.
Let the number three guide you, and you shall find my island.'

YOU: 'How is a stoplight a great thing? *Sigh* I can't say I understand the guy, but an island party is an island party. Let's get decoding, I guess.'

Objective: Determine the name of the island. The flag will be the name of the island enclosed by curly braces and prepended with ictf.
Example: If the party were hosted in Happy Coconut Island, the flag would be ictf\{Happy Coconut Island\}

We can use numpy to implement an image filter and extract a watermark.
