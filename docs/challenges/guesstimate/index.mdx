In this challenge, you have to 'steal' the model used in performing the sentiment analysis of a series of sentences.
This is a page that describes [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis).
This challenge is inspired by the paper [Stealing Machine Learning Models via Prediction APIs](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/tramer).
Solving this challenge requires being able to replicate how the service scores sentences using its sentiment analysis model.

It would be convenient to know the results ahead of time... How could you achieve that?
