When Max goes to the pool and he enters the pool with a stride jump from 64 meters high!! Tell me what your array is and I will tell you his secret

<Spoilers type="writeup">

To solve the challenge apply maxpooling (either manually or by creating a model with a maxpooling layer) with a stride of 64. Then reshape your array to 1x27 array and feed it to the max_64.py. You will want to use [numpy](https://numpy.org/) to do so. This will give you the flag!
