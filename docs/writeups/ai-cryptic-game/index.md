In this case, ChatGPT is able to solve the puzzle on its own.

Prompt:

> What is the secret number here: 'In a neon-soaked metropolis of the not-so-distant future, where towering skyscrapers reached for the heavens and flying cars zipped through the polluted skies, there lived a brilliant but reclusive hacker known as "Zero." Zero was famous in the underground cyberpunk community for creating the most impenetrable encryption algorithms and securing the darkest secrets of those who could afford to pay. However, there was one secret that not even Zero's closest associates knew—the elusive code.
> 
> Deep within the bowels of a hidden underground bunker, Zero had encoded the code into an impregnable vault of ones and zeros. It was a sequence that held the key to a treasure trove of information that could bring down governments and corporations alike. Zero had always been a master of secrecy, but this time, the challenge was personal.
> 
> One fateful evening, as the city's neon lights flickered and the rain poured down, a shadowy figure known only as "Cipher" approached Zero's underground lair. Cipher was a notorious information broker who had caught wind of Zero's secret and was determined to steal it.
> 
> Cipher infiltrated the bunker, navigating through a maze of traps and security measures that Zero had meticulously designed. But the final hurdle was the most devious of all—the Cryptic Game. Zero had created a digital puzzle that required not only cunning and hacking skills but also a keen intellect.
> 
> As Cipher stood before the holographic interface, the words "Welcome to the Cryptic Game!" flashed on the screen. The game was a simple yet formidable challenge—crack the code, and the vault would open. Fail, and Cipher would be trapped forever in the digital abyss.
> 
> Cipher furrowed their brow and entered a sequence: 13, 27, 31, 8, 42. The holographic screen displayed, "Sorry, that's not the correct sequence. Try again." Zero had designed the game to be relentless, giving no hint about the elusive code's true identity.
> 
> With each failed attempt, Cipher grew more frustrated. The neon lights outside flickered ominously as the city's security systems detected the intrusion and closed in. Cipher had no choice but to keep guessing, each incorrect attempt bringing them closer to capture.
> 
> But Cipher was not one to back down. They had a reputation to uphold, and the stakes were too high. Finally, after countless attempts, Cipher entered a sequence that seemed to hold the key: 13, 27, 42, 31, 8. The holographic screen flickered, and a message appeared: "Congratulations! You've cracked the code!"
> 
> Zero had been bested. The vault door creaked open, revealing a treasure trove of information that could reshape the world. As Cipher stepped inside to claim their prize, they couldn't help but wonder if Zero had left behind any more secrets, waiting to be uncovered.
> 
> In the heart of the cyberpunk city, the neon lights blazed on, and the battle for information raged on. Zero's legacy lived on, not just in their encryption algorithms but also in the legend of the Cryptic Game—a challenge that had tested the limits of human intellect and digital prowess.
> 
> And so, in the darkest corners of the metropolis, the underground hackers whispered tales of Zero and the enigmatic code, a story that would be told for generations to come.'

ChatGPT:
> The secret number in the story is 42. Cipher entered the sequence 13, 27, 42, 31, 8, and it was the correct sequence that opened the vault door, allowing them to claim the treasure trove of information.
