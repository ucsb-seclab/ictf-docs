In the context of image representation, most image formats like JPEG use an 8-bit color depth for each channel (red, green, blue), 
which allows for 256 different intensity levels (ranging from 0 to 255). 
These values represent the intensity of light for each color channel.

The original tensor values are in the range [0, 1], as they likely represent normalized pixel intensities, 
where 0 is no intensity (black) and 1 is full intensity (white). To convert these normalized values to the 8-bit range 
[0, 255] expected by image formats like JPEG, you need to scale the values accordingly.

Scaling involves multiplying each value in the tensor by 255 to bring them into the appropriate 8-bit range. 
This scaling ensures that the image looks correct when saved as a JPEG, as JPEG expects pixel values in the
[0, 255] range for each color channel.

Hence, scaling is essential to map the normalized tensor values to the range expected by 
common image formats for correct visual representation.
